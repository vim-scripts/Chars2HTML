This plugin will convert between characters(ISO-8859-1) and their HTML \\\"&xxxxxx;\\\" entity in the current file. Its a rewrite of html_da vim vimscript #1163, this plugin can be used on all filetypes and contains more special characters and their HTML encoding. Nice plugin if you often copy text to use as HTML, with special european characters(ISO-8859-1), embedded in various programming languages.
